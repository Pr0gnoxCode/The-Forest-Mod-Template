# TheForest_Mods
Hellowww there

I've created my first Mod Menu project for the game "The Forest". I know, there is ModAPI and lot's of more mods to get out there in the internet but I just want to get my own one and learn with it how to mod games. As it is my first one please be aware that the code etc. maight be looking awful to you but for me was it a nice learning expirience. I'll try to keep it up to date as much as I can and try to add further functions.

Feel free to copy that project as a source for you to create your own Mods for the Forest.

Installation Guide:

1.) Download MelonLoader and the requert installation files: https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=requirements 

2.) Install MelonLoader V0.5.5 into your The Forest folder (example: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Forest") I know there are newer Versions of MelonLoader but they somehow don't work! 

3.) Donwload my Visual Studio Project or clone it into your VS direcetly. 

4.) Check the dependcies/references in the project if they are still there and if not, you will need to add them to the projekt. 

4.1) If you don't know how, watch here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/managing-references-in-a-project?view=vs-2022 Think about to copy or backup the .dll files you need, before starting using them!!! you will need following .dll's: Assembly-CSharp / 0Harmony / UnityEngine / MelonLoader find them in your "\The Forest\TheForest_Data\Managed" folder and ofc. in "\The Forest\MelonLoader" 

5.) Have fun coding and learning how it works to write Mods ;)

Last but not least: I don't take any responds for that code if it doesn't work or if you destroy your mashine with that (which will be very unlikely =D !)
